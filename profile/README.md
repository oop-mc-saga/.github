# Lecture on Object Oriented Programming

Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that treats the subject matter of information processing as objects that are composed of data and their operations.
The OOP helps to create relations between real-world object and programs.
It also provides tools for efficient program development through super classes and inheritance. 

This series of courses treats OOP with Java and provides some practical examples
